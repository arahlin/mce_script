DO NOT EDIT THE SCRIPTS IN THIS DIRECTORY.  CHANGES MADE HERE WILL BE LOST.

This is not a checked out copy of the subversion repository, but rather an
installed build of mce_script.  To edit the scripts here, check out a local
copy of mce_script somewhere else, edit the scripts, and then run

  sudo make install

from the top level directory.
