Installing MCE Script
=====================
-DVW, 2012-05-01, svn.r930

In the past, the MCE script tree was checked out directly into /usr/mce/mce_script (or wherever
$MAS_ROOT was pointing).  We now encourage people to check out MCE script elsewhere and then
install a read-only copy into /usr/mce/mce_script.

To build and install MCE script first build it by running:

  make

from the top-level directory.  (The directory containing this file) and then install it with

  sudo -E make install

The install rule requires you to set MAS_VAR to the full path of the mas_var program installed
as part of MAS.  If MAS_VAR isn't defined, for a standard install, the following should work
in bash:

  export MAS_VAR=/usr/mce/mas_var

(The -E in the sudo call prevents sudo from scrubbing your definition of MAS_VAR from the
environment.)

---------------------------------

NOTE: The legacy method of checking out MCE Script directly into /usr/mce/mce_script still
works.  Feel free to keep doing that on existing installations if you don't want to change.
