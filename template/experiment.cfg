# Template for MCE config settings file
#

## This file contains a variety of information, including hardware
## presence/absence, a description of the experiments default run
## parameters, and a set of variables that are updated by the
## auto-tuning program.  This ultimately becomes the source data for
## mce_make_config, which produces a bash script that puts the MCE in
## a desired state.

## To read from or write to the parameters in this file, use the
## mas_param program.  If you want to access this data from IDL,
## mas_param can create a set of functions that facilitate this.

## These comments are only present in the template version of the
## config file.  Once the file has been modified by an automatic
## agent, comments and formatting are stripped.
