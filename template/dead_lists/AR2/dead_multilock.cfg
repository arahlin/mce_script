# dead_multilock

# Detectors that are chronically multi-locked.  There is usually
# little hope for such detectors as they just live somewhere funny on
# the sq2 curve.  If an sq1_servo row choice is revised, the multilock
# template should be rechecked.

# 08.09.08 - MFH: Created. Detectors cut based on Mark Halpern's
#  multilock analysis from Sep. 5th.  Although column 8 features
#  prominently in Mark's plots, those problems are due to SA biasing
#  and not squid 1 placement.  Of the remaining multi-locks, all but 5
#  are due to dead squids.  These are: r10c31, r18c6, r21c01,c06,c31.

# 09.04.28 - MFH: added r02c16.  We are having issues with rows 20, 21.

n_rows=41;    #This describes the mask array below, not the experiment!!

# Note that 'columns' run down and rows run across!
