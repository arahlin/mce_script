# dead_connection

# Detectors marked dead due to some known (or unknown) issue with
# entire rows or columns of squids or detectors.

# 08.09.08 - MFH: Created.  AR3 has broken sq1 fb on column 31, broken
#  SA line on column 24 (probably in MCE flex), and a bad SQ2 on column
#  26.  Due to swapped cables, row 15 is not connected to anything.
# 08.10.03 - MFH: Killed row 27 because the sq1 bias has been turned
#  off.  r27c13 is a bad ramper and contaminates its whole column.
#  This is likely due to a bad squid1; see MDN mail from Oct. 2.

# Mask for use with gain_mask program.  Detectors marked as 1 will be turned off.

n_rows=41;    #This describes the mask array below, not the experiment!!
n_cols=32;

# Note that 'columns' run down and rows run across!
