# dead_multilock

# Detectors that are chronically multi-locked.  There is usually
# little hope for such detectors as they just live somewhere funny on
# the sq2 curve.  If an sq1_servo row choice is revised, the multilock
# template should be rechecked.

# 08.09.08 - MFH: Created. Detectors cut based on Mark Halpern's
#  multilock analysis from Sep. 5th.  Column 9 problems were
#  eliminated by fixing an SQ2 bias bug.  Column 27 and 19
#  multi-locking dets are badly behaved; they are off in
#  dead_squid1.cfg.  Row 15 and C24, C26, C31 are also not included
#  since they're disconnected.  Some other ones here are just dead.

n_rows=41;    #This describes the mask array below, not the experiment!!
n_cols=32;

# Note that 'columns' run down and rows run across!
