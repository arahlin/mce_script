# dead_jumpers

# Detectors that show a tendancy to unlock.

# 08.09.08 - MFH: Created. Cuts based on analysis of Sep. 3 data,
#  looking at all dets that commonly had more than a single flux jump
#  in the first 50k frames of _dat files over the course of the night.
# 08.10.02 - MFH: Turned off r00c05 and r22c25 based on chronic
#  jumping on Sep 21-23, 30 and Oct 1.
