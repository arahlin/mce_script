# dead_connection

# Detectors marked dead due to some known (or unknown) issue with
# entire rows or columns of squids or detectors.

# 08.09.08 - MFH: Created.  Row 15 is disconnected.  Row 16 is off due
#  to low amplitudes and bad behaviour. Row 2 is extremely
#  multi-locked (it is unsalvageable if you look at the place_sq1
#  output) os is included here too.

n_rows=41;    #This describes the mask array below, not the experiment!!
n_cols=32;

# Note that 'columns' run down and rows run across!
