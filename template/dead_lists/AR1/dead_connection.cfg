# dead_connection

# Detectors marked dead due to some known (or unknown) issue with
# entire rows or columns of squids or detectors.

# 08.09.08 - MFH: Created.  Row 15 is disconnected.  Row 16 is off due
#  to low amplitudes and bad behaviour. Row 2 is extremely
#  multi-locked (it is unsalvageable if you look at the place_sq1
#  output) os is included here too.
# 10.03.24 - MFH: up-dating.  Row 16 and 2 seem to be somewhat usable
#  now.  We have lost rows 5 and 11.
# 10.09.29 - MFH: Row 31 marked dead.
