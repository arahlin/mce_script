# Template for MCE config settings file

# This is not a particularly nice or flexible solution, but it
# works. The mce_script "mas_param" can parse this file and output the
# information in a variety of different ways.

# If first character on a line is '#', the line is ignored.  Lines
# with only whitespace are also ignored.

# Format of definitions is "key: data...".  The key must be a single
# word, and should start with a letter, contain only letters and
# numbers and underscores, etc.  There is no line continuation character.
# You also can not place comments after the data on a key line.


# Hardware description - should be read only as far as idl is concerned!

# Experimental configuration - data rates, row configuration

#  To calculate the frequency of data readout given the parameters
#  specified below, use the following equation:
#    reported_dataframe_rate (Hz) = 1/( 20ns * row_len * num_rows * data_rate)
#  When row_len = 128, num_rows = 41 and data_rate = 48, then the
#  reported_frame_rate is 198.4 Hz
