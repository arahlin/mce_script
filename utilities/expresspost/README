expresspost
===========

expresspost will want to run as root, and to have access to a
passwordless ssh key for copying files over.

It works by monitoring a directory on the local system for files
matching a certain pattern.  Those files are interpreted as lists
(with a particular syntax) of files to copy to the remote system.


Configuration
-------------

expresspost is configured through some variables set in the daemon
launching script, "expresspost".  Modify this script before installing.

For example in "expresspost" we might set up the following variables:

SOURCE=/home/mce/tuning_data/
DEST=mhasse@gamow.phas.ubc.ca:tuning_data/
SSH_KEY=/home/mhasse/.ssh/id_rsa_pw
SPEC=file_list

These describe:
 SOURCE     the local directory to watch for updates
 DEST 	    the ssh host and directory where the files should end up
 SSH_KEY    the ssh key to use
 SPEC 	    the file name to search for on the local system.

So this setup will watch /tuning_data on the local system.  Any files
called "file_list" will be parsed.


Installation
------------

Run
 sudo make install

This will install /etc/init.d/expresspost, and will also create a link
in /etc/rc2.d/S90expresspost so that expresspost will get launched
each time the computer starts up.  To start/stop expresspost manually, run:

 /etc/init.d/expresspost start
 /etc/init.d/expresspost stop


File list syntax
----------------

The file lists should look like this:
 prefix 1234500000/
 file 1234500001.png
 file 1234500002.png
 complete

The script will copy the two files to subdirectory "1234500000" on the
remote system (then it will write "ack" onto the end of the file
list).
